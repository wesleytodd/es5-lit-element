# `lit-element` transpiled to es5

The `lit-element` package is not transpiled to es5 by the team which maintains it. [Because reasons?](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html/issues/516).

This package is the same thing (with mirrored versions), but transpiled to es5 using babel.

```
$ npm install --save es5-lit-element
```

See the [`lit-element` docs](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide) for usage.
